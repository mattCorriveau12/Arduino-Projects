# ArduinoProjects

I2C Project

-  Allows two Arduino Nanos to communicate with each other via I2C. This project was created to demonstrate the I2C Decode function of an Oscilloscope.

SPI Project

-  Allows two Arduino Nanos to communicate with each other via SPI. This project was created to demonstrate the SPI Decode function of an Oscilloscope.

Combined I2C/SPI Project

-  Combines both the I2C Project and SPI Project code so that the 2 Arduino Nanos are communicating via both SPI and I2C sending slightly different messages so they can be differentiated when observed through the I2C or SPI Decode Function on an Oscilloscope.
